            <h3>Blockchain</h3>
            <p>A blockchain is a database that is shared across a network of computers. Once a record has been added to the chain it is very difficult to change. To ensure all the copies of the database are the same, the network makes constant checks. Blockchains have been used to underpin cyber-currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. In basic terms blockchain is like a digital ledger. "Blockgeeks" have a good analogy, picture a spreadsheet that exist on all the computers across the world that is updated instantly. It is consistently checked and is hard to hack as it exist in no one central place. </p>

            <h3>Immersive Tech</h3>
            <p> Immersive Tech is technology that seeks to seamlessly merge the virtual with reality. It does this by integrating the user's reality with the virtual construct. When using immersive tech the user accepts the virtual reality as the true reality and begins to disassociate with real life. Examples of immersive tech is VR headsets </p>

            <h3>Robots</h3>
            <p>Most robots today are used to do repetitive actions or jobs considered too dangerous for humans.</p> 
            <p>Robots have core principles:</p> 
                <ul>
                    <li> A robot may not harm a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</li>
                    <li>A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</li>
                    <li>A robot must protect its own existence, as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.</li>
                </ul>
