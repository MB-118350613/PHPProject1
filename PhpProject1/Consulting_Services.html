            <h3>Blockchain</h3>
            <p>As each transaction occurs it’s encoded into a block of digital data and uniquely signed or identified.Each block is connected to the one before and after it — creating an irreversible, immutable chain.
               Blocks are chained together, preventing any block from being altered or a block being inserted between two existing blocks.
               A blockchain is a database that is shared across a network of computers. Once a record has been added to the chain it is very difficult to change.
               To ensure all the copies of the database are the same, the network makes constant checks. Blockchains have been used to underpin cyber-currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. In basic terms blockchain is like a digital ledger. 
               "Blockgeeks" have a good analogy, picture a spreadsheet that exist on all the computers across the world that is updated instantly. It is consistently checked and is hard to hack as it exist in no one central place. </p>

            <h3>Immersive Tech</h3>
            <p> Immersive technologies are modes of altering, replicating, or enhance reality.
                An umbrella term, this includes augmented, virtual, and mixed realities.
                Immersive technologies have promised a great deal of widespread improvement across the energy industry, but a lack of audience and an unwillingness to take risks has prevented large-scale uptake.
                Recent hardware developments and changing public and industry attitudes are now altering attitudes, and we would expect to see far more of these different tech solutions in the next few years. 
                Augmented reality is a technology that combines a user’s view of the real world with additional digital assets to provide a combination of virtual and real.
                When a user uses immersive technology they accept the virtual reality as the true reality.</p>

            <h3>Robots</h3>
            <p>Robots are any automatically operated machine that replaces human effort, though it may not resemble human beings in appearance or perform functions in a humanlike manner. 
                By extension, robotics is the engineering discipline dealing with the design, construction, and operation of robots.
                Most robots today are used to do repetitive actions or jobs considered too dangerous for humans.</p> 
            <p>Robots have core principles:</p> 
                <ul>
                    <li> A robot may not harm a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</li>
                    <li>A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</li>
                    <li>A robot must protect its own existence, as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.</li>
                </ul>
