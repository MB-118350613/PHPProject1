            <h3>GAA</h3>
            <p>Hurling has been a huge part of my life for a very long time and is undoubtedly my favourite pastime.
             I have made friends for life from this sport and I have had a very successful career with my local team Inniscarra GAA.
            One of the reason I enjoy Hurling so much is due to the great team spirit that is cultivated in Inniscarra.
            On top of this GAA is great for your personal health and fitness, really proving the saying "healthy body healhty mind". </p>

            <h3>Weightlifting</h3>
            <p>I have been attending the gym in and out for some time period, however since I began college I became more serious about it.
            Weightlifting is something I enjoy doing and I will enjoy the benefits that will eventually arrive
            I have an interest of one day competing in a competition.
            My hero and someone I admire in this sport is Eddie Hall who has broken numerous world records and holds the current deadlift record of 500kgs.
