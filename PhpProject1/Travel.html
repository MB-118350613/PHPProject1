            <h3>New York </h3>
            <p>I visited the city of New York in the summer of 2017. It was an amazing experience one I really enjoyed and  I felt like it really broadened my horizons.</p> 
            <p> While there I Visited places such as the Brooklyn harbour, the Empire State, Grand central Stadium etc. I can not recommend New York more.</p>

            <h3>Machu Picchu</h3>
            <p>Machu Picchu was unlike any other city I had been to. The sights were incredible given the altitude I was at, the surrounding scenery was picturesque and breathtaking.</p>
            <p>The city itself ,situated on the side of a mountain, was hard to access but was well worth the effort.</p>
