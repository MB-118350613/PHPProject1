            <h3>New York </h3>
            <p>I visited the city of New York in the summer of 2017. 
            It was an amazing experience one I really enjoyed and  I felt like it really broadened my horizons.
            While there I visited places such as the Brooklyn harbour, the Empire State, Grand central Stadium etc. 
            Without doubt my favourite place to visit was the Harbour, as someone who loves the coast and sea the sea in general the harbour was amazing.
            Packed to the brim with lovely restaurants, and also beautiful walks along the river.
            I can not recommend New York more, I would jump at the chance to return.</p>

            <h3>Machu Picchu</h3>
            <p>Machu Picchu was unlike any other city I had been to.
            It had been a city I had wanted to visit for some time so when the chance arrived I was over the moon.
            The sights were incredible given the altitude I was at.
            I can not stress how incredible the view was, due to Peru's low pollution and the height I was at the sky was cyrstal clear.
            The surrounding scenery was picturesque and breathtaking.
            The city itself ,situated on the side of a mountain, was hard to access but was well worth the effort.</p>
